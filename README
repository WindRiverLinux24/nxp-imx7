        i.MX7D Sabre Board Support Package

1. About this document
======================

This document describes common and non-hardware specific information.
Please refer to README.hardware for hardware specific information.

Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River
Linux and the wr-kernel layer.

Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.

Building the nxp-imx7 layer
---------------------------
This layer and wr-kernel layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This
is done automatically when using the Wind River configure wrapper.

2. BSP Kernel and Distros
=========================

The following table summarizes the valid Wind River Linux distros for this BSP.
'Y' in each content cell stands for supported; 'N' stands for not supported:

  +--------------+-------------+------------------+-------------------+--------------+
  | valid/distro |   wrlinux   | wrlinux-graphics | wrlinux-installer | wrlinux-tiny |
  +--------------+-------------+------------------+-------------------+--------------+
  |    valid     |      Y      |        Y         |         N         |       N      |
  +--------------+-------------+------------------+-------------------+--------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

Note: The preempt-rt ktype is available for this BSP/Machine at this time.

3. Board Specific Patches
=========================
To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

	# cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/nxp-imx7/kernel-source
	# git whatchanged standard/base..


4. Boot Instructions
====================

4.1 MMC/SD Boot
---------------
User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/4.0.5/dev-manual/common-tasks.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After build the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<bsp name>/ ,such as:

tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx7/wrlinux-image-std-nxp-imx7.wic

Then user can write the output image to a SD card.

4.2 NFS Root File System
------------------------

4.2.1 Prepare Kernel, DTB, NFS and TFTP servers
-----------------------------------------------
The files in the following example can be found in <buildprj>/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx7
and are copied to the export directory of the TFTP server.

4.2.2 Download kernel
---------------------

	# tftp ${loadaddr} zImage

4.2.3 Download DTB
------------------

	# tftp ${fdt_addr} imx7d-sdb.dtb

4.2.4 Set bootargs and boot the system
--------------------------------------

	# setenv bootargs console=ttymxc0,115200 root=/dev/nfs rw \
		 nfsroot=<nfs server>:<nfs root>,v3,tcp \
		 ip=<target IP>::<gateway>:<netmask>::eth0:off
	# bootz ${loadaddr} - ${fdt_addr}

Note: for MCIMX7D-SDB board, $loadaddr="0x80800000", $fdt_addr="0x87000000"

5. Features
===========

5.1 Static PM
-------------

The debug UART can be set as a wakeup source with:
	# echo enabled > /sys/class/tty/ttymxc0/power/wakeup
	# echo mem > /sys/power/state

5.2 CPU frequency
------------------

CPU frequency scaling allows the clock speed of the CPU to be changed on the fly.

	# echo powersave > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
	# cat /proc/cpuinfo

5.3 ANATOP thermal
-------------------

	To check current CPU temperature
	# cd /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0
	# cat temp
	39821
	# cat trip_point_0_type
	passive
	# cat trip_point_0_temp
	95000

5.4 Audio
---------
Play audio messages:

For imx7d, enable Output Mixer PCM like the following:
amixer sset 'Right Output Mixer PCM' on
amixer sset 'Left Output Mixer PCM' on

	# aplay -Dhw:0,0 stereo1644s.wav


5.5 PCIe
--------

Since the PCIe connector on-board only exports PETP0/N0, PERP0/N0 and 3.3V
pins, any mini-PCIe devices that use other PCIe pins won't be supported.
The following PCIe peripherals are validated:

	Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205
	Intel Centrino Wireless-N 1030

The PCIe driver does not support hotplug and suspend/resume.

5.6 WiFi
--------

Due to the LICENSE issue, we can't provide the firmware files in wrlinux,
You can get these firmware files from imx7d SDK v5.15.32 rootfs: /lib/firmware/brcm/
brcmfmac4339-sdio.bin & brcmfmac4339-sdio.txt
or you can contact with Murata in the web https://wireless.murata.com/

We validated the WiFi module by the firmware version:
	BCM4339/2 wl0: Feb  7 2018 06:16:29 version 6.37.39.92 (r683655 CY)

5.7 CAAM
--------

Running OpenSSL benchmarking tests with AF_ALG engine:

root@nxp-imx7:~# modprobe algif_hash
root@nxp-imx7:~# modprobe algif_skcipher
root@nxp-imx7:~# modprobe algif_rng
root@nxp-imx7:~# modprobe algif_aead
root@nxp-imx7:~# openssl speed -engine afalg -multi 8 -elapsed -evp aes-128-cbc


6. kexec/kdump
==============

For discussion purposes, some useful terminology will be described here.

boot kernel - the first one that you start and supports kexec, from u-boot
	      for instance
capture kernel - the kernel that you reboot into after a boot kernel crash

To build the boot kernel, use the following configure option to configure
the project:

     --templates feature/kdump feature/kexec

To reserve a memory region for capture kernel, you need to pass the bootargs argument "crashkernel"
as follow:

    crashkernel=256M@2256M

For dump-capture kernel:
Before boot dump-capture kernel, please add "maxcpus=1" to the boot parameter.
Note: please use zImage as a secondary kernel. It can be found in the
  tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx7/
directory.

For more detailed info about kdump, please refer to Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt
in the kernel source tree.

7.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

To burn uboot and WIC images to SD card, user need to execute command:
# dd if=wrlinux-image-std-nxp-imx7.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

7.2 Set uboot env
-----------------

Board can boot automatically by set the below uboot environment variables:

For i.mx7d
=> setenv bootfile zImage; setenv fdtfile imx7d-sdb.dtb;  setenv loadaddr 0x80800000; setenv fdtaddr 0x87000000;
=> setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootdelay=5 console=ttymxc0,115200n8'
=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 0:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; bootz $loadaddr - $fdtaddr';
=> saveenv; run bootcmd;
